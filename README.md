# Web-Scrapping
The application depicts an example of crawling E-commerce websites like flipkart, TataCliq and extracts required information from the page. The crawled data is formatted to fit in a dataframe (using the pandas library) and the fetched product image is pre-processed before displaying in the console (using the Pillow library). Also, the code is platform independent.
